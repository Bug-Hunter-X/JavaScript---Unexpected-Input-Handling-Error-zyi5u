# JavaScript - Unexpected Input Handling Error

This repository demonstrates an example of unexpected input handling and its resolution in JavaScript.

## Bug Description
The JavaScript code in `bug.js` attempts to add 1 to a number. However, it throws an error when the input is not a number.  The error handling is not sufficient to prevent the runtime error, making it susceptible to unexpected data.
